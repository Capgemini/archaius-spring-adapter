**********TODO*******

Get the spring property placeholder to support JDBC too - do it with duplicates - then move the common bits into the shared file
make the JDBC URl use URL semantics ("?abc=123&wed=576" etc)
Make all the "getStringProperty()" calls take a valid default rather than a repeat of the key
add extensive javadoc to the placeholderconfigurers
port the junit tests to spock
derby shutdown exceptions

*********TOO HARD************
make everything live in location/locations (jdbc et al)
	do a single entry with "jdbc:..." - we need to be able to add/register a new Spring Resource implementation to do this

	
**********DONE****************	
clean out the system.properties and evenMoreSystem.properties from src/main/resources
